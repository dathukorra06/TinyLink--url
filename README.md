# TinyLink--url
Build a small web app similar to bit.ly, where users can shorten URLs, view click statistics, and manage links. 1. You may use Node.js + Express or Next.js — your choice. 2. Use any lightweight CSS (plain CSS or Tailwind). 3. Host it using free services such as Vercel, Render, or Railway, with a free database service such as Neon (Postgres).
